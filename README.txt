Assignment 1            Mira Jefferson

Cipher.py contains all of "Part 1: Encryption" with caesar cipher and vigenere cipher
crossCorrelation.py and crackingCodes.py are both for "Part 2: Cracking Codes"

For 2.1 I'll have a photo in github of how I solved it by hand! 
Because xo was repeated, I thought of two-lettered words that are used all the time such as
"of, at, to, or". I tried of and was easily able to figure the key being -9

Also, my answer for cross correlation should print out when my code is ran!
